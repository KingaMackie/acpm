### A Good Alternative to Get True Cigarette Experience

Most smokers dread the thought of giving up or not being able to have a puff when they are smoking. Nicotine patches quell the urge to some degree but it's not an instant solution. Vape and e-cigarettes are the best alternatives in this respect because they fulfill smoker’s requirements of traditional cigarettes, which is nicotine hit in the throat and the sight of smoke being exhaled. 

Today, I’m going to review the latest popular pod-style electronic cigarette, Hexa and compare it with the most popular closed pod system brand JUUL at present and see the differences.

#### Specifications

Both of the brands have the same thing in their starter kit: a vape device, pods, a USB charger, and a user manual (or warranty). The differences lie in the battery life and the pods capacity. Hexa’ battery has a capacity of 350mAh. Each Hexa Pod has a volume of 2ml with 20mg nicotine salt. While JUUL’s battery is much lower. It should be charged after 6-8 hours’ use. Then the pod volume is 0.7ml, also lower than Hexa.

In terms of flavor, Hexa starter kit includes tobacco flavor, other flavors are menthol, blueberry, and menthol tobacco. And the starter kit of JUUL has Virginia tobacco, mint, mango, and crème flavors.

#### Design & Style

Both of the vape devices adopt black and grey and make it in a modern and simple design. Hexa has a sleek dark metallic grey body, with a black base and mouthpiece. The pods have a curved tapered mouthpiece, and a tinted body to help maintain that overall sleek look. The coating on the frame has a very smooth finish, which seems strong scratch resistant. And the LED indicator light is positioned in the center of the device in a nice diamond shape, only lights up while firing the device, and then flashes to either highlight overdraw protection or low battery. Such modern and elegant design appeals to both male and female vapers. Due to its portability, Hexa pod is a pocket-friendly device and can be a good companion on the trip. And the JUUL is made in a squarer style in both mouthpiece and device.

#### Impressive Features

##### 1.Pod System

As a pre-filled system pod mod, the real essence of the vape experience boils down to the pods themselves. The Hexa pods adopt ceramic coils which provided by FEELM Tech, a company that is aimed at improving vaping performance with its [new vaping technology that increases safety and efficiency of the heating process](https://www.feelmtech.com/). As satisfying as this pod is, this technology can heat and vaporize the E-liquid uniformly and sufficiently, making sure each puff is soft and smooth. Compared to another closed pod system brand JUUL, it produces more clouds and a more natural flavor. Moreover, in our test, the pods do not show any sign of leaking, which is a difficult problem to fix in the closed pod system.

##### 2.Longevity-decent Battery Life

In contrast to JUUL’s 6-8 hours battery lives, the Hexa battery is 350mAh and can be used all day long without charging. The built-in FEELM coil ensures a large surface area contacting with the e-liquid, which is enough to last all day without charging up. Compared to other e-cigarettes in the market, Hexa is more suitable for those who need to go out or who don’t like recharge often. Anyway, the combination of 2ml capacity and the ceramic coils does lead to the Hexa pods having a very good battery life.

##### 3.Mouth to Lung Vaping Style

There are two basic vaping styles, DTL (Direct-to-lung) vaping and MTL (mouth-to-lung) vaping. Hexa supports mouth to lung vaping which is a great option for beginners. Mouth-to-lung is the best choice for people looking to experience the maximum flavor and minimum cloud creation. When you use Hexa vaping, it gives your tongue a chance to really taste your favorite flavors. Aside from this factor, mouth-to-lung vaping is also great when vaping in public places—or any spot that you don’t want others to be annoyed by massive vapor clouds.

If you’re a smoker and have already tried unsuccessfully to quit smoking or switch to vaping, you owe it to yourself to try a Hexa.
