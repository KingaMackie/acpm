There are various medical implications for smoking cessation specially when long-term high-volume consumption is ceased. Today, in 2015, we have a tendency to think about a 1PAD (1 pack a day) habit as significant. Average consumption is currently (2015) reported as around 12 - 15 cigarettes each day by smokers in the united kingdom.

## A quick note on harm

It is reasonably clear that smoking is connected with harm. Typically, smoking is hazardous; and the much longer it is carried out for, the higher the risk. Therefore, though it is unquestionably incorrect to state that smoking does not have any benefits - that is obviously incorrect when the issues are researched, as can be seen evidently below - there will tend to be better alternatives in the 21st century.

It really is equally wrong to state that smoking cessation has no significant implications - it could and does bring about both small and serious morbidity, as outlined below. Even so, since we are certainly in the 21st century now, perhaps it is time to explore additional avenues of prophylaxis and treatment for vulnerable sub-populations.

## Minor vs serious symptoms

From the above list, we see there are numerous common small symptoms of smoking cessation, almost all of which pass with time; and far less commonly, symptoms related to some serious medical ailments connected with smoking cessation for many reasons.

For example of the small symptoms, the Quit Ulcers and the Quit Zits appear fairly regular. The 'quit ulcers' happen to be oral cavity ulcers experienced by some, which vanish reasonably quickly. The 'stop zits' are an interesting but less prevalent phenomenon: facial boils and areas resembling pimples that appear after smoking cigarettes cessation even in individuals who never had acne in youth. These facial aberrations could be distressing and inexplicable for those who have never experienced acne; and can be persistent. That is to say, they are able to last for weeks; and the sufferers are unlikely to survey they consider the challenge to be insignificant or of zero importance. Indeed, some survey this effect of smoking cessation as considerably disruptive to their lives.

The more serious implications are luckily rare, because they can and do relate with serious disease. Thyroid conditions and auto-immune diseases will be implicated. For completeness, we should also consider the likely implications for serious neurodegenerative diseases associated with non-smoking status.

### Thyroid conditions

The thyroid issues are under investigation. It would appear that smoking, or cigarette smoking cessation, are connected in some individuals with thyroid circumstances such as Hashimoto's Thyroidosis. In other words, we have no idea if cigarette smoking triggers it and cessation triggers it or increases its effects; if smoking masks it; or if smoking cigarettes cessation triggers it in those without any previous sign of the condition.

The ECF forum, although strictly speaking a vaping forum, can be by its very nature the world's major smoking cessation forum, and groundbreaking research has been completed by the professors of medicine, doctors, researchers, chemists and pharmacists who are members - not forgetting the vast membership. The 16 million posts on the discussion board address several problems, and if you wish to research thyroid concerns and smoking, medical section on ECF is really as good a location as any to start. Incidentally, there are a few alarming symptoms associated with incorrect thyroid drugs dosages reported there, if is of interest to anyone.

### Neurodegenerative conditions

Neurodegenerative and auto-immune disease are actually strongly connected with non-smoking status. Smoking cessation has serious implications for those with a genetic vulnerability to 1 auto-immune disease (ulcerative colitis). As an example, it really is reported that a lot more than 40 distinct clinical studies show a solid correlation between non-smoking position and Parkinson's disease. Dr Maryka Quik, a senior researcher, states: â€œ An enormous literature says that smoking cigarettes protects against Parkinson's. "

Perhaps smoking protects against Parkinson's because of the nicotine inclusion, since research shows nicotine works well in treatment, plus some genetic subgroups may require a significant supplementation of the normal dietary component; but after a particular time period, the harmful ramifications of smoking will have a tendency to override any benefits, and for that reason nicotine might greatest be supplemented in a few other way, if it's indeed the sole agent in prophylaxis.

### Auto-immune conditions

One auto-immune disease, ulcerative colitis, is indeed strongly connected with non-smoking position that it's been termed 'the non-smoker's disease'. It is also apparent however, not confirmed by study that presentation can be associated with cigarette smoking cessation: a peak in presentations seems to occur soon after cessation. It can be plainly a genetic condition because it will run in families; and non-smokers are in more risk than smokers.

## Implications
These serious conditions are uncommon. Nevertheless, they are life-changing and in some instances eventually fatal. So that it would seem to point that some exploration of family history could possibly be beneficial: if such diseases are available in the history then certainly some preventive methods could be set up before or immediately after smoking cessation.

Currently, we've no idea what works best (or at all) in this situation, but some kind of dietary nicotine supplementation appears advisable. The problem is actually this: we think nicotine is the dietary nutrient that avoids neurodegenerative and auto-immune circumstances for the vulnerable sub-population (but are not absolutely sure, especially about its sole activity); but we've no thought what dosages work or whether or not nicotine is the sole prophylactic or treatment agent - anatabine for instance is another alkaloid found in tobacco, and has a proven medical function as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent - it really is now used in procedures for rheumatism. This can be relevant since auto-immune ailments may also be categorised as inflammatory diseases.

In the past it is said that doctors have occasionally recommended two cigarettes a day in such situations, given the serious nature of such diseases, in the case of a person with a family group history indicating vulnerability, and for the reason that elevation of risk for morbidity with 2 cigarettes each day is infinitesimal weighed against significant associated risk for a serious disease. Today, it appears likely the same doctor would advise some other form of smoking supplementation, given the option of numerous ultra-low-risk nicotine goods both with and without pharmaceutical licenses.

## Conclusion

As yet we do not have enough information about nicotine-based prophylaxis to create any definitive statements; Dr Newhouse of Vanderbilt leads the procedure investigation currently. It really is apparent there are benefits in fact it is also obvious that nicotine has all the indications essential for classification as a B supplement, similarly to its sister substance nicotinic acid. We basically have no idea enough about its effects in isolation, or the supplementary dosages (i.e. the RDA, and its supplementation for vulnerable populations) to provide advice that is apt to be appropriate or widely agreed.

For clarity, it is worth pointing out that should you have a family background of neurodegenerative disease, or auto-immune disease, and so are a smoker seriously considering cessation, in that case perhaps it could be wise to look at the issues along with your doctor. At this time, considering the prevalence of propaganda, and how it really is proven to affect even authorities and may lead to medical negligence, you may consider finding better advice if your present doctor knows nothing about these issues or offers advice that is clearly incorrect by the most recent standards.
